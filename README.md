This module, available for Node.js and Titanium SDK, wraps the Liferay JSON WS into an easier to use (and easier to test!) API.

Works and tested with **Liferay 6.2.x** and **6.1.x**, both CE and EE.


Installation
------------

With **npm** you can easily install it with

    npm install --save liferay-connector

If youâ€™re working on a **Titanium SDK** project then head over the [releases page][rp] to download the latest packaged module.

Usage
-----

An example is worth thousands of words.

```js
var liferay = require('liferay-connector');

liferay.authenticate('http://localhost:8080', {
    login: '??',
    password: '??'
}, function (err, session) {
  session.invoke({
  	"/group/get-user-sites": {}
  }, function (err, sites) {
  	console.dir(sites);
  });
});
```
